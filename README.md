- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander and my online name is Kaharot.
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming and Web development.
- 🌱 I’m finished learning HTML and CSS and currently learning JavaScript. Plus i did not stop learning HTML and CSS cause there is lots work to be done.
      After i get some basics in JS i plan to start learn maybe REACT but sure yet. 
- 💞️ I’m looking any internship or job related with FrontEnd development. Free or paid, 1 or 6 months, any is good as long i get some experience from it.
- 📫 You can reach me via
      E-mail: andric.aleksandar87@gmail.com
